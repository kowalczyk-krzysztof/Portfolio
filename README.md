<h1>My portfolio website</h1>

Made with React, Redux, styled-components (CSS in JS).

<h2>Notes about Redux usage:</h2>

<p>The localization implementation is not ideal. In a bigger project it would be better to serve different routes for different languages (e.g with a prefix like "pl") but for a small project with not much text, I think it makes sense to use Redux. Storing the text in a JavaScript object isn't the best practice either, but it works fine for this project.</p>

<h2>Notes about CSS and form validation:</h2>
<p>I intentionally didn't want to use any libraries/frameworks for implementing CSS and form validation. As mentioned before, the goal was to practice so I wanted to write my own CSS and form.</p>
